# This script creates a firtool wrapper to launch firtool within a Docker container.  This assumes that
# firtool is being used within a larger project, and therefore the script attempts to mount the project
# workspace into the container so that firtool can write files outside the current directory.  The
# PROJECT_ROOT variable defines the root of the project workspace.
#
# If PROJECT_ROOT is not defined, mounts the current directory as the work directory.  Note that if firtool
# then attempts to access directories higher than the current directory the command will fail.
